# A STEP TOWARDS GREENER FUTURE - *SHILPA CO-OP HSG SOCIETY ROOFTOP SOLAR PROJECT*

## Introduction
As an initiative taken by the MC of Shilpa Co-Op. Hsg. Society, we are thinking of installing our own On-Grid Rooftop Solar System. 
This article aims to give a clear picture of following points to the society members:

**1. What is On-Grid Rooftop Solar Photovoltaic (PV) System?**

**2.	Why think of our own Rooftop Solar PV System?**

**c)	The Power Requirements of the Society** 

**d)	The potential of available space**

**e)	Expected investment and Return on Investment schedule** 

**f)	Conclusion**


***a)	What is On-Grid Rooftop Solar Photovoltaic (PV) System?***

It is a set of electricity-generating solar panels mounted on the shadow-free space available on rooftop of a building. It captures 
the sun's light energy and converts it into electrical energy. The generated electrical energy, which is Direct Current (DC), is 
converted to alternating current (AC) by an inverter and is then supplied back to the power grid (in our case MSEB) through a net meter. 
(as shown in fig. 1)

***b)	Why think of our own On-Grid Rooftop solar PV system?*** 

Our terrace spaces are unused. These spaces can be utilized to install our own Rooftop Solar PV system. As shown in figure 1; the power 
generated by the Solar system is supplied back to MSEB. The Net Meter keeps track of the amount of power (units) supplied back to MSEB. 
MSEB then adjusts the power (units) used by the society against these and charges the society only for the extra power used. This means,
the society becomes self-sufficient for the power it consumes. 

***c)	The power requirements of the society***

The total annual power requirement of the society in terms of wattage is 50 Kilo Watt (KW). This includes the common lights in premise
of all four buildings, all lifts, water pumps, swimming pool, gym, community hall, Ganesh Mandir and garden. The average power consumption
per meter and the MSEB sanctioned load is given in table 1.

| *Consumer Number*   |	*Sanctioned Load*	  | *12 months total in units  consumed* |	*Watt (KW)*  |
| -----------------   |	-----------------	  | ------------------------------------ |	---------    |
|    160260521478	    |      16.0 KW	      |                 15624	               |      2.4      |
|    160260520455	    |      42.0 KW	      |                 34398	               |     27.3      |
|    160260520455	    |       8.1 KW	      |                  7590	               |      6.0      |
|    160260520455	    |       8.0 KW	      |                  3016	               |      2.3      |
|    160260520455	    |       3.8 KW	      |                  2626	               |      2.0      |
|    *Total Wattage*  |                     |                                      |     50.0      |

***d)	The potential of available space***

The total terrace area of all four buildings is 21000 Square feet. We have identified two MNRE approved vendors so far. Both the vendors have
conducted survey of the society and submitted their proposals. As per the survey conducted by prospective vendors, the actual usable area
(shadow-free free space excluding the existing Solar Water Heaters) is 8000 square feet. Solar System of total 60 KW can be installed in this 
free space. MSEB approves Rooftop Solar PV Systems of capacity only up to the sanctioned load. Our total sanctioned load is 77.9 KW. 
**This means we can install Solar PV System to fulfil our requirement, well within our sanctioned load.**

We have invited the vendors to give project presentation to the MC members. The presentation will include, the basics of In-Grid Solar PV System,
how it works in collaboration with MSEB, the installation specifics, the benefits and most importantly the expected Return On Investment.

***f)	Conclusion***

Comparing the investment involved with the estimated Return on Investment schedule and the society's estimated savings over the years, the increasing
number of EV vehicles and the proposed our own EV Charging station (as explained above in Point E), it is **strongly suggested** to Managing Committee,
to consider this project and put the proposal of the Rooftop Solar PV System in next General Body Meeting for voting.
