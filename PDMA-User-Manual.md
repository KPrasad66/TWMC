### WORKING PRINCIPLE
PDMA works on the principle of Column Pressure of Static Fluid as shown in figure 1.1

![Working Principle](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/130212523/231403543-012985cc-7b53-49a3-9326-b33b81c769f0.png)
<br>figure 1.1<br>

The pressure in static fluid arises from weight of the fluid. It is expressed mathematically as:

![Equation1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/130212523/231414551-f9727561-9460-42d5-8501-fead2ed99147.png)
<br>
Where

<br>ρ = Fluid Density
<br>g = Gravity
<br>h = Depth (Height) of fluid<br>

Static Fluid Pressure does not depend on Shape, Total Mass or Surface Area of the fluid.The Acceleration due Earth’s Gravity
is constant. For a Column of fixed dimensions; the Height of the fluid column is constant.
So any variation in the Pressure is only due to the Density of the Fluid.
