### WORKING PRINCIPLE
PDMA works on the principle of Column Pressure of Static Fluid as shown in figure 1.1

![Working Principle](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/130212523/231403543-012985cc-7b53-49a3-9326-b33b81c769f0.png)
<br>figure 1.1<br>

The pressure in static fluid arises from weight of the fluid. It is expressed mathematically as:

![Equation1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/130212523/231414551-f9727561-9460-42d5-8501-fead2ed99147.png)
<br>
Where

<br>ρ = Fluid Density
<br>g = Gravity
<br>h = Depth (Height) of fluid<br>

Static Fluid Pressure does not depend on Shape, Total Mass or Surface Area of the fluid.The Acceleration due Earth’s Gravity
is constant. For a Column of fixed dimensions; the Height of the fluid column is constant.
So any variation in the Pressure is only due to the Density of the Fluid.

<br>
<br>

<br>

#### USER INTERFACE

PDMA offers an easy to use interface with 2 line backlit LCD display and Soft-touch Keypad. Batteries charge level and the set test
parameters are displayed on the first line. Once the test is completed and stable reading is achieved, the results are displayed on
the second line. The steps to use the instrument and carry out the tests is explained under section [Operating Procedure](#operating-procedure)

<br>

#### FUNCTIONS

Functions of the Keybord buttons are as shown in talbe 1

![Functions](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/130212523/231463855-647f3377-8d63-40a8-a0f1-f34ad6eab4e3.png)

### SAFETY INSTRUCTIONS

#### PRODUCT SAFETY

Avoid any liquid spillage on the display and Keypad. Wipe the surface clean after every use. Extended spillage can cause corrosion
and short-circuit of the electronics.

#### PERSONAL SAFETY

Always use protective gloves and glasses while handing the chemicals.

#### STORING THE PRODUCT

Clean the sample vial and sample chamber after every test. When storing the instrument for longer period, make sure both the Drain 
port and Sample Lure port are caped firmly; remove the batteries and store separately.


### SAMPLE PREPARATION

- Check the specified Test Temperature.
- Heat / Cool 10 ml sample to specified temperature. Make sure temperature of the sample is stable. 
- If you have optional TCC (Temperature Control Cell) accessory, fill the vial of TCC with sample (10 ml).
- Bring the sample temperature to the specified test temperature
- Once the set temperature is reached and is stable, immediately perform the test.
